# Critique Games (In Progress)Fangzhi ZhaoFeb 8 2017## I. Overview**Critique Games** explores the alternative means to investigate art critique through the lens of games. The project consists of a collection of fictional critique games, which could be implemented and played in reality but also imagined and executed through thought experiments.### Game Studies and Art CritiqueThe foundation of this project is the **Magic Circle Theory.** First coined by Dutch historian Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) in *Homo Ludens: A Study of the Play-Element in Culture,* the theory uses a delineated “magic circle” to distinguish the binary in-game world versus the real world, which binds a space and sets it apart from normal life. Inside the magic circle, different rules apply, and it is a space where game players can experience things not normally sanctioned or allowed in regular space or life. Inside the circle is an artificial, structured and differentiated dimension.Art critique, on the one hand, surprisingly resembles a space within the magic circle, i.e. a game, where all participants behave more or less differently from their real life and follow distinct rules and conventions. While on the other hand, these rules and conventions and, moreover, goals, processes, constituents, beginnings, ends etc. of this "game" are yet ambiguous and unclear. ## II. Critique Games###Time- **Time Capsule:** The artist presents/introduces their work to the critique panel. The critique panel critique the work 1 month later.- **Time Capsule (Advanced):** The artist presents/introduces their work to the critique panel. The critique panel critique the work 1 year later.- **Time Capsule (Ultimate):** The artist presents/introduces their work to the critique panel. The critique panel critique the work 10 years later.- **Hang In There For An Hour:** The artist under critique mustn’t bring anything work, has to be totally unprepared and hang in there for a full hour long critique session.- **Hang In There For An Hour (Variation):** No artist under critique. The critique panel have to stay there for a full hour long critique session.- **Hang In There For An Hour (Variation):** No artist under critique. No critique panel. Hang in there for a full hour long critique session.###Language- **Q & A:** The artist under critique can only ask questions. No any kinds of statements. The critique panel can only answer the questions.- **Q & A (Variation):** The critique panel can only ask questions. No any kinds of statements. The artist can only answer the questions.- **No Talking:** The artist and the critique panel can only communicate in written form, no talking.- **One liner:** The critique panel can only respond one line to the work. No limits for the artist.- **One liner (Variation):** The artist can only say one line about the work. No limits for the critique panel.###Roles- **Inversion:** The artist brings work then switch roles with a member of the critique panel. That member will be the new artist under critique and present the work. The artist will be a new critique panel member.###Miscellaneous- **Pre Game:** The artist and the critique panel get 5 shots of vodka then start the critique.- **Noise Canceling:** The artist wears sound proof ear pods during the whole critique.###  III.
