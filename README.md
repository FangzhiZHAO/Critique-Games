# Critique-Games

Critique Games is a work in progress, which explores alternative means to approach and investigate art critique through the lens of games. This project consists of a series of thought experiments/games. While these imaginary experiments/games could be implemented and played, the project itself doesnâ€™t require the execution of them.
